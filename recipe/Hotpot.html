            <p>I wanted the richness of long-simmered chicken stew, but without the fuss of using a whole chicken. This
                compromise, using boneless skinless chicken thighs with bone-in chicken breast, gave me the richness of
                flavor
                and ease of preparation I was looking for! It's basically chicken pot pie made in a pressure cooker
                rather
                than
                an oven.

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Pour the olive oil into a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as an Instant Pot®) and select the
                    Saute function. Cook onion, carrot, celery, and bay leaf until the vegetables are soft and the onion
                    has
                    turned translucent, about 5 minutes.
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    Add chicken broth, chicken thighs, chicken breasts, thyme, marjoram, salt, and pepper. Close and
                    lock
                    the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 9 minutes.
                    Allow
                    10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    Release pressure carefully using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions,
                    about 5 minutes. Carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs and place them in a bowl to cool
                    slightly; discard bay leaf.
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    Mash butter with the flour to make a smooth paste; set aside.
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    Combine flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl for the dumplings. Cut in cold butter until mixture
                    is
                    the texture of cornmeal. Stir in parsley and set aside.
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    Shred cooled chicken and return to the pot. Taste the broth and adjust the seasoning if needed. Add
                    peas
                    and green beans. Stir in the flour-butter paste. Select Saute function to bring broth back to a
                    boil.
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    Pour buttermilk into the dumpling mixture and stir until combined. Drop the dumpling dough by
                    heaping
                    spoonfuls on top of the stew; a small cookie scoop works well.
                </li> <br>

                <li>
                    Cover pot with the lid, leaving the steam vent open. Select Slow Cooker function and simmer on Low,
                    covered, until dumplings are cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. A skewer inserted in the center of a
                    dumpling should come out clean.
                </li>
            </ol>
